1. Accidental component:
	- position next to note
2. Calibrate Note movement
	- calculate spacing between lines
	- note should move one 'step' when its letter changes (i.e., D -> Db is not a step, but Db -> C is)
3. Add new note onClick in the location where you click
	- refactor any functions that use the app.state.notes array to make sure they're referring to the right note.
	- default new note to selected
	- Add new note name display component when a new note is created
4. Create an IntervalDisplay component to display the interval between two notes
	- write the function that calculates # of half-steps using the chromatic scale and then maps to appropriate interval
		- make sure to handle the difference between Augmented 4th and Diminished 5th depending on spelling (i.e. C -> F# vs. C -> Gb).
