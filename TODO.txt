1. Create an IntervalDisplay component to display the interval between two notes
	- write the function that calculates # of half-steps using the chromatic scale and then maps to appropriate interval
		- make sure to handle the difference between Augmented 4th and Diminished 5th depending on spelling (i.e. C -> F# vs. C -> Gb).
	- when three notes are on the staff, there should be three interval displays (eg. C-E, E-G, and C-G), four - four, etc.
	- write a function to convert the intervals into chord names/inversions and display the chord name when three or more notes are present.
2. Implement a database using PostGres or firebase to store chords in a list
	- add a save button: onClick saves it to database
	- clicking on a list entry should render that chord to the grand staff
	- updating the chord and saving should alter the chord at that list entry
3. Deploy!
