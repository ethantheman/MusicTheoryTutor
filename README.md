Solo Week Project
---
Welcome to my solo week project! I am attempting to build a tool that my music students can use to practice learning their intervals and chords. The bare minimum MVP will be a grand staff that renders two movable notes and dynamically updates the interval between the two notes and allows the user to store intervals in a list (clicking on a list entry would render the particular example of two notes to the grand staff).  The MVP+ feature I'm shooting for is an option to add a 3rd note to the staff and show the user what chord they are looking at. This will require a lot of edge casing.  The biggest challenge getting out of the gate will be the styling of the grand staff and designing the movable note components.
